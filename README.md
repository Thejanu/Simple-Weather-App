# 🌤️ Simple Weather App

This is a basic weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can enter a city name to view real-time weather data including:

• Temperature (°C)

• Humidity (%)

• Weather condition (e.g., overcast clouds)

• A matching weather icon

The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data. It features a responsive design with a clean UI and soft gradient background.
